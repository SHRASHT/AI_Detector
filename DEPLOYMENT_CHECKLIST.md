## Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup
```bash
# If not already done:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Deepfake Detector with feedback learning"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/ai-deepfake-detector.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Streamlit Community Cloud Deployment
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New app"
4. Select your repository
5. Set main file path: `app.py`
6. Click "Deploy!"

### 3. Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Image upload works
- [ ] Predictions are generated
- [ ] Feedback system functions
- [ ] Sample images load correctly
- [ ] Admin panel accessible
- [ ] Database operations work

## Expected App URL
`https://your-username-ai-deepfake-detector.streamlit.app`

## Key Features to Test

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Upload image (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
- [ ] View prediction (Real/Fake)
- [ ] See confidence percentage
- [ ] Load sample images
- [ ] View technical details

### Feedback Learning System üß†
- [ ] Mark prediction as correct/incorrect
- [ ] Add optional notes
- [ ] Submit feedback successfully
- [ ] View learning statistics in sidebar
- [ ] See total feedback count
- [ ] Check model accuracy percentage

### Admin Features
- [ ] Enable admin panel
- [ ] View feedback data
- [ ] Download feedback CSV
- [ ] Monitor performance stats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Check `requirements.txt`
2. **Memory Issues**: App optimized for 1GB RAM limit
3. **File Not Found**: Check relative paths
4. **Database Errors**: SQLite will be created automatically

### Performance Notes
- First load may take 30-60 seconds (model initialization)
- Subsequent predictions are faster (cached model)
- Feedback database grows over time
- Admin panel may be slower with large datasets

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- [ ] App deploys without errors
- [ ] All imports work correctly
- [ ] Model loads and makes predictions
- [ ] Database operations function
- [ ] UI is responsive and attractive

### User Experience
- [ ] Easy to upload images
- [ ] Clear prediction results
- [ ] Intuitive feedback system
- [ ] Helpful learning statistics
- [ ] Professional appearance
